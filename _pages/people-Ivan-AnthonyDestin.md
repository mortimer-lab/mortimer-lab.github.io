Hello! My name is Ivan-Anthony Destin and I am a fourth-year Microbiology student pursuing a minor in Korean Language and Literature. I am generally interested in infectious diseases, viruses, and antimicrobial resistance, but I became particularly interested in Dr. Mortimer's work after attending a guest lecture she taught in my introductory microbiology course. I have no previous experience in genomics, computing, or bioinformatics, but I hope to improve on these skills and learn a lot during my time in the Mortimer Lab.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy watching soccer and basketball, listening to music, dancing, practicing my Korean skills, spending time with my sisters, and playing board games or card games.
