My name is Pavani Bommana, and I'm originally from Andhra Pradesh, India. I hold a Master's degree in Pharmacoinformatics from the prestigious National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) and a Bachelor's degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Kakinada (JNTU-K). Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics under the supervision of Dr. Tatum Mortimer at the University of Georgia.

My research interests lie in the application of genomics and proteomics to better understand antimicrobial resistance. I aim to identify biomarkers and leverage this data to develop AI models that can contribute to the better diagnosis and treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy traveling, cooking, crafting, and spending quality time with friends.
