Hi! My name is Jamie Markowski, and I am from Frenchtown, New Jersey. I am currently a sophomore majoring in Microbiology with a minors in Public Health and Entomology in the Morehead Honors College. I have been fascinated by microorganisms for as long as I can remember, and I am particularly interested in infectious disease and genetics, which are two things that the Mortimer Lab researches. Even though I do not have much experience with bioinformatics or computing in general, I am eager to learn and apply these skills to genetics research. After my undergraduate years, I plan on furthering my education at graduate school with the eventual goal of working in the field of Public Health.
