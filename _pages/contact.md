Thank you for you interest in the Mortimer Lab at UGA!

### Undergraduate students

If you are an undergraduate interested in working in the lab, please reach out through email. Whether or not you plan to register for research credit, the [CURO Getting Started Guide](https://curo.uga.edu/students/getting_started_guide.html) is a good resource for appropriate ways to contact a faculty mentor.

### Graduate students

Currently, the lab is affiliated with the College of Veterinary Medicine's [Comparative Biomedical Sciences](https://vet.uga.edu/education/phd-and-masters-degree-programs/comparative-biomedical-sciences-graduate-program/) graduate program. Starting Fall 2024, we will also be affiliated with UGA's [Integrated Life Sciences](https://ils.uga.edu/) graduate program.

### Postdoctoral researchers

If you are interested in a postdoctoral position, contact me about opportunities. In your email, please include a brief cover letter outlining your previous research experience and interests in the lab, a CV, and contact information for three references.
