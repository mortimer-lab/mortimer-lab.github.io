I received my MSc in Nanoengineering from NC State University. After graduation, I spent 2 years as a Research Specialist at MUSC, and I have been a Research Professional at UGA since 2019.  

I joined PDRC in 2024 and am the lab manager for the Mortimer and Joshi Labs.  

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, paddle boarding, reading, and crocheting.
