I am a PhD student at the University of Georgia. My current research focuses on enhancing our understanding of infectious diseases by utilizing deep learning algorithms. I completed my Bachelor's degree at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences in Pakistan. I received the Pak US Knowledge Corridor scholarship. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy traveling and engaging in arts and crafts.
