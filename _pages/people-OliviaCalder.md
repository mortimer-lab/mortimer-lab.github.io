My name is Olivia Calder, and I am a senior Biology major on a pre-med track with a minor in Human Development and Family Science. I joined this research lab to gain experience in bioinformatics while deepening my understanding of the mechanisms behind disease transmission and antibiotic resistance. In preparation for my future goal of attending medical school, I have also gained professional experience as a medical assistant at an OB/Gynecology practice and as a clinical research intern. Outside of academics and research, I enjoy baking, attending concerts, spending time with my sister and friends, and running.
