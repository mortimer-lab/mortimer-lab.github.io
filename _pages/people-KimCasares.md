Kim, a proud New Mexico native and McNair Scholar, is pursuing her doctorate in bioinformatics at the University of Georgia. After earning her Bachelor of Science in Biology from New Mexico State University, she turned her focus to understanding one of healthcare's most pressing challenges: bacterial resistance to existing treatments. Through bioinformatics research, she works to unravel the complex mechanisms behind antimicrobial resistance. When she's not analyzing data or conducting research, Kim finds balance through her love of literature, fitness, and music.
